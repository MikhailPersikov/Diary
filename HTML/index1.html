    <h2>What is a variable?</h2>
    <p>A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a sentence.</p>
    <p>Always declare JavaScript variables with  <strong>var</strong>, <strong>let</strong>, or <strong>const</strong>.</p>
    <p>The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.</p>
    <p>The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.</p>
    <p>If you want your code to run in older browser, you must use <strong>var</strong>.</p>
    <h2>When to Use JavaScript const?</h2>
    <p>If you want a general rule: always declare variables with <strong>const</strong>.</p>
    <p>If you think the value of the variable can change, use <strong>let</strong>.</p>
